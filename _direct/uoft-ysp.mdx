Does medicine = doctor? Often times that’s how it is perceived but even before you get into medical school you’ll need to choose a program of study at a unviersity.

The Faculty of Medicine’s Youth Summer Program  (MED YSP) at University of Toronoto offers an engaging, educational, and fun program to learn about science, research and the wide array of medical careers. This summer meet students from across Canada and over 10 different countries; talk to instructors, professors; do at-home activities; get tips on how to prep for university; compete in The Great Game Show; have a chance to win prizes, and much more! Choose from four disciplines to explore your curiosity or to expand on your knowledge:

1) In the physiology module, understand how your body works; whether it’s from filtering 180 L of blood a day to keeping your body in balance or how all your systems spring into action during a fight-or-flight situation.

2) In molecular biology, get down to the DNA level and learn how a single base pair change in our DNA can have catastrophic consequences. With recent advances in genetics the future of personalized medicine will be yours.

3) In pharmacology & toxicology, learn how drugs work and how your body responds. Why is it that the same drug can save someone and kill another person?

4) In microbiology, whether it’s SARS, COVID19, MERS, Ebola, or the next unknown bug, you’ll learn how microbes are transmitted; how beneficial they are to us; and how they can turn against us.
