<p>[Various Opportunities]</p>
<p>Our more than 450 volunteers are the heart and soul of CHATS and make a
positive difference in the health and wellness of more than 8,100 York Region
and South Simcoe older adults and their caregivers each year.</p>
<p>Our volunteers play an integral role in the lives of our clients – delivering
meals on wheels to older adults at their homes; engaging them in activities at
CHATS programs; making friendly phone calls; driving them to medical
appointments, errands and malls; providing essential administrative support in
our office, and more.</p>
<p>Volunteering with CHATS gives you the opportunity to meet new people, learn new
skills have fun – and it’s flexible! You choose how you want to volunteer with
older adults based on your interests, skills, schedule and availability. Be a
volunteer out in the community, or in your own home – we will work together to
find the volunteer role that’s right for you.</p>
<p>CHATS is committed to providing programs and services that meet the cultural
and linguistic needs of older adults. As such, we invite volunteers from
diverse communities to join us.</p>
