<p> Sunrise works with all kinds of volunteers – from students to senior citizens. Volunteers help to organize outings and activities, or just spend an afternoon hanging out with our residents. Whether you have a passion that you’d like to bring to Sunrise or a skill that can be used to benefit the lives of our seniors, we’d like to hear from you. </p>
