<p> York Universityâ€™s Spark Lab Programs are week-long sessions designed for students in grades 9 to 12 
who want more hands-on science. Using experiment-based learning, students explore physics, biology, 
chemistry and coding through lab work. Escape the traditional classroom and learn science by doing science. </p>

<p> The Spark Lab Program is an open-enrollment program and is on a first-come-first-served basis. 
Registration can be completed online and a residence option is also available. </p>
