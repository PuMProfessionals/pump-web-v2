<p> The CNSI Nanoscience Lab Summer Institute is an exclusive summer workshop for high school students with a background in chemistry that are interested in 
advanced science and technology. During this five day program, students have the unique opportunity to explore technologies similar to those currently 
investigated by the scientific community through hands-on experiments that give students a survey of diverse topics, including bio-toxicity, supercapacitors, 
and photolithography. Moreover, these experiments, designed by UCLA researchers, teach students the key concepts of nanoscale phenomena that make nanoscience 
and nanotechnology one of the most exciting fields of research today. </p>
