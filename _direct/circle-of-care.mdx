<p> Volunteers are at the core of Circle of Care.  From delivering Kosher Meals on Wheels food, 
to friendly visits with isolated older adults to providing companionship and caregiver relief to someone 
with a life limiting illness, our volunteers are kind, compassionate, and have a strong desire to help 
older adults in our community live happier and healthier in their own homes.  Learn more about the many 
volunteer opportunities at Circle of Care and become a volunteer today! </p>
