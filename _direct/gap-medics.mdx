<p> Our high school student placements are available all year round, with the flexibility to start any 
weekend you like. Our minimum placement length is one week, but there is no maximum (we recommend two weeks 
to gain a full experience, or longer if you want to experience more departments). </p> 

<p> Over the summer (May to September), programs are exclusively for students aged 16 and 17. Outside that 
period, we combine with our over 18 age group to give a more sociable experience during quieter times. The 
same 24-hour supervision is provided and mentoring remains tailored to your age, but youâ€™re likely to be in 
a smaller group and it can be a great chance to meet students who have already begun their university 
pre-med track. </p>

<p> Requirements: </p>
<ul> 
    <li> 16-17 years of age </li>
    <li> $450 registration fee </li>
</ul>
