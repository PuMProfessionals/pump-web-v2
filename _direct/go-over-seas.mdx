<p> Volunteering abroad is one of the most gratifying and impactful experiences you’ll ever choose to take part in. You get to see how every person’s conscious contribution to humanity and nature is essential to human rights and the longevity of life on this planet. You’ll also return home with a newfound outlook on how to create change everyday in your own life — and how to discern when your generous intentions may be detrimental. </p>

<p> If you want to give back to causes you care about and don’t know where to begin, you’ve come to the right place. At Go Overseas, we are committed to providing information that will help you leave a positive impact through volunteering abroad. Use our expert resources to learn more about how to volunteer overseas, requirements to meet before filling out your program application, financial aid help, and information on how to avoid the unethical pitfalls of volunteer abroad scams. </p>

<p> Requirements: </p> 
<ul>
    <li> Age Minimum: Programs may have a minimum age of 18, but there are plenty of high school volunteer programs available. There are also volunteer programs aimed at more mature travelers too! </li>
    <li> Physical Ability: Some assignments may demand a higher degree of physical activity. If so, they will list it to ensure you can participate.</li>
    <li> Passport & Visas: In order to go abroad, you’ll need to be eligible for a passport in your home country and apply for visas as necessary.</li>
    <li> Language: If the assignment that caught your eye is in a country where English isn’t widely spoken, you may encounter a foreign language requirement.</li>
    <li> Field Experience: if your volunteer assignment requires professional skills (like medical work) you may be required to have six months to a few years of professional experience in order to be eligible for the program.</li>
    <li> A Good Attitude: while this may seem like a no-brainer, some volunteers forget this isn’t a vacation. You’ll have to be positive, adaptable, and willing to work hard.</li>
    <li> Volunteering abroad may be popularized by young travelers, but it isn’t exclusive to them. While many programs require volunteers to be at least 18 years old, others may be specifically geared to high school students, families, and even adults who’ve long completed their education.</li>
