<p> [Multiple Locations] </p>

<p> WoodGreen offers a wide range of social services to a very diverse clientele: helping them find 
employment, safe housing, affordable childcare, and giving settlement support to immigrant newcomers to 
Canada. We also provide access to mental health services and supportive services for seniors so they can 
remain at home for longer. </p>

<p> As a community social services organization, we recognize the need to help students gain the practical 
knowledge and skills necessary to become social service professionals to continue our work in the community. 
WoodGreen offers a limited number of college and university placements to students who are studying to work 
in this sector. </p>
