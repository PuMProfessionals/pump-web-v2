<p> Volunteers are an essential part of life at Kensington Health. Our volunteers are valued members of our 
team and play a significant role in our life-enhancement programs. We depend on volunteers for support with 
a wide range of services including friendly visits with residents, assisted eating, food preparation, social 
events, and more. Person-centered care is our first priority and volunteers help to make a difference in the 
lives of our residents and their families. </p>

<p> Volunteering is a wonderful to way to learn new skills, give back to the community or decide if a 
career path is right for you. We have a variety of opportunities available at Kensington. Choose which 
Kensington Health entity you would like to volunteer at, and fill out the volunteer application form. </p>
