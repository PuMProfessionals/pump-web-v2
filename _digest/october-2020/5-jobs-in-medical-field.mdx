summary: “When I grow up, I want to be a gerontologist,” said no one, ever. I highly doubt that even people who are gerontologists right now knew that such a career even existed as a kid. Who can blame them though? No one talks about them. Let’s take a closer look at 5 different jobs in the medical field you probably haven’t thought about.

<p> “When I grow up, I want to be a gerontologist,” said no one, ever. I highly doubt that even people who are gerontologists right now knew that such a career even existed as a kid. Who can blame them though? No one talks about them. Let’s take a closer look at 5 different jobs in the medical field you probably haven’t thought about. </p>
<ol> 
    <li> Cytotechnologist </li> 
    <p> What did the cell say to his sibling when she stepped on his shoe? Ouch, mitosis! Cytotechnologists prepare and evaluate tissue and human cell samples through a microscope to see if they carry different diseases including (but not limited to); cancer, bacterial infections, and leukemia. To become a cytotechnologist, you will require a minimum of a bachelor’s degree from an accredited cytotechnology program. The average salary for a cytotechnologist in Canada is $31.79 per hour. If you are independent, interested in cytology, microscopic work, and are comfortable with a high degree of responsibility, being a cytotechnologist is something you should look into. </p>
    <li> Perfusionists </li>
    <p> “My heart will go on!” Hopefully, since it’s a perfusionist’s job to make sure it does. Perfusionists handle the heart and lung machines that take over the functions of patients’ organs while they are in surgery. You will need a certified clinical perfusionist(CCP) credential to be entitled to this job. Perfusionists do not necessarily have to work full-time, they even occasionally work as needed whenever called. An average perfusionist will make $51.40 per hour in Canada. If you have precision, self-confidence, and enjoy biology, I would recommend diving deeper into the world of perfusionists. </p>
    <li> Gerontologists </li> 
    <p> You may either love or hate working with seniors, but for gerontologists, it’s their job! Gerontologists specialize in the field of aging-related things of change over the lifespan of an average human. There are different types of gerontologists such as; research gerontologists, applied gerontologists, and administrative gerontologists who all play different roles in gerontology. To become a gerontologist you must have a Bachelor’s Degree from an accredited college or university. The average gerontologist makes $118 per hour in Canada. If you have patience, compassion, and enjoy working with elders, gerontology could be the job for you. </p>
    <li> Space Psychologists </li> 
    <p> Many people may think going to space seems fun but turns out that a lot of people just aren’t cut out for the job. A space psychologist advises selection panels about which astronauts are the most capable for different teams and missions. They also counsel crews before, during, and after flights. To become a space psychologist, you need a PH in psychology and you must be trained in multi-disciplinary. This means that you will need to be well informed in scientific areas such as neuroscience, history, and biology. An average psychologist makes $54.05 per hour in Canada. If you are empathetic, a good communicator, and are interested in space, the work of a space psychologist might spike your interest. </p>
    <li> Orthotists </li>
    <p> Why are prosthetics companies the best? Because they’re always willing to lend a hand! An Orthotist evaluates patients and judges the strength of their muscles and makes and fits braces and splints for those who are medically impaired. To become an Orthotist, after receiving a master’s degree in prosthetics and orthotics you must complete a full year of residency before you are eligible to apply for the national certification boards. The average Orthotist makes $26.42 per hour in Canada. If you are investigative, social, and enjoy helping people be their best versions, orthology is for you. </p>
