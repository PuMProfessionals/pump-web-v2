summary: 'You’re now starting your final year of high school, senior year, Grade 12. There are many things to look forward to such as graduation, prom, and making those last few memories with your friends before you head off to start the next journey in your life. Before all these exciting things happen, the first semester can be quite stressful. The time has come to finally decide where you are going to apply for post-secondary whether you choose to take a gap year, go to university or college, or even decide to work, these decisions are all made by you during this one semester.'

<p> You’re now starting your final year of high school, senior year, Grade 12. There are many things to look forward to such as graduation, prom, and making 
those last few memories with your friends before you head off to start the next journey in your life. Before all these exciting things happen, the first semester 
can be quite stressful. The time has come to finally decide where you are going to apply for post-secondary whether you choose to take a gap year, go to university 
or college, or even decide to work, these decisions are all made by you during this one semester. </p>

<p> So you decide that you want to maybe become a physician in the future, or a dentist, someone in the healthcare field, so what program should you go into? 
There are around 96 post-secondary schools in all of Canada, each having their own unique programs, the campus’, and originality. At the end of this article, 
you’ll be able to learn about what each of the different programs offers at each university. Here are some programs that I personally applied to during my 
application process: </p>

<ul>
    <li> McMaster Health Sciences/Life Sciences </li>
    <li> Queen’s University Health Sciences/General Sciences </li>
    <li> Western Medical Sciences/Health Sciences </li>
    <li> University of Toronto Life Sciences </li>
    <li> McGill Biological, Biomedical, and Life Sciences </li>
</ul>

<h3> Difference Between Health, Life, and Medical Sciences: </h3>

    <th> Programs </th>
    <th> Information About Program </th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Health Sciences </td>
    <td> The Health Sciences program takes a look at health through an interdisciplinary approach. Health Sciences offers students an understanding of health from biological, behavioural and population-based perspectives, by analyzing both health, medicine and the healthcare system. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Life Sciences/General Sciences </td>
    <td> The Life Sciences programs take a look at a general view of life in the world ranging from human health to plants and other organisms. While this program is very broad, one is able to choose a major to narrow down their studies in upper-years. </td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Medical Sciences </td>
    <td> The Medical Sciences program is only offered at The University of Western Ontario. This program looks at the molecular, cellular, and systematic organization of the human body and the biological mechanisms it uses to adapt to environmental changes and diseases. </td>

    <td> McMaster Health Science </td>
    <td> Lucy </td>
    <td> “After considering what I personally valued from a university program, I narrowed down the factors I considered to be most important to 1) courses 2) facilities and 3) network. I heard a lot about McMaster’s problem-based learning style and as a student who hated taking physics and maths in high school, not seeing those courses listed as mandatory for first-years was a huge plus for me. I also looked into the course descriptions on the Faculty of Health Science website and loved the interdisciplinary + holistic approach they took towards teaching their students about healthcare! On top of academics, I chose McMaster for the amazing research facilities and hospital opportunities they offer students, and also just because I vibed really well with the student environment – everyone seemed super friendly and interesting to chat with!” <strong>– Lucy Zhao, McMaster Health Sciences</strong> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Queen’s Health Science </td>
    <td> Sanchit </td>
    <td> “The Bachelor of Health Sciences program at Queen’s University was intriguing to me due to the flipped classroom format of the core classes and its commitment to enhancing face-to-face interactions via innovative and engaging classroom sessions. The small size of the cohort in comparison to other health/life science-based programs was another pull factor for me, as I thrive in small group environments where I am able to interact with peers. Not to mention, the beautiful campus and location of the university were what reaffirmed my decision!” <strong>– Sanchit Kaushal, Queens Health Sciences</strong> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> The University of Toronto St. George Life Sciences </td>
    <td> Henry </td>
    <td> “I chose to attend the Life Sciences program at the University of Toronto because first, it is closer to home so I can visit my family and friends more often, second, I got into the Trinity One stream which I liked the idea of the small class specifically for those who want to study medicine, third, I think there are a lot more research/extracurricular opportunities, and lastly I received the President’s Scholars of Excellence Scholarship” <strong>– Henry Guan, University of Toronto Life Sciences</strong> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> McGill Biological, Biomedical, and Life Sciences </td>
    <td> Asma </td>
    <td> “I decided to attend McGill because of the plethora of research opportunities available both on and off-campus and the ability to choose a specific major under the general biomedical sciences degree that will cater to my individual scientific interests. The option to take the Honours pathway was also greatly appealing as someone interested in attending graduate or medical school. Additionally, I’m excited to explore a city as culturally rich and diverse as Montreal!” <strong> – Asma Khamis, McGill Biological, Biomedical, and Life Sciences</strong> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Western Medical Sciences </td>
    <td> Rose </td>
    <td> “One of the main reasons why I chose to go into Medical Sciences at Western was because of the campus and the community. When I was deciding between programs, one of the major deciding factors was whether or not I would enjoy the campus and the things it had to offer. I also have the AEO status that allows me to graduate with a double degree in Medical Sciences and Business. I found that many of the well established pre-med programs were pretty similar content-wise so it was just down to which campus I liked better” <strong>– Rose Li, Western Medical Sciences</strong> </td>
