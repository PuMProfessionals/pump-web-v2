<p> High school. An incredibly memorable, hectic, and exhilarating 4 years of your life. According to all those cheesy high school movies, it is a time when you go to parties every other night, when you ditch class to go on wild adventures with your friends, and when everyone in the cafeteria can simultaneously burst into song and dance… It doesn’t take a genius to realize that high school is nothing like how it’s portrayed in the movies. As a high school student myself, I know firsthand just how busy our daily schedules can get. Between all the homework, volunteering, part-time jobs, and extracurricular activities, there is barely time where you can just be a teenager, let alone go to wild ragers every other night. I understand how difficult it can be to maintain a social life while also keeping up with all of your academic commitments, so here are 4 tips to help you accomplish just that. </p>
<ol>
    <li> <strong>Do Homework With Peers</strong> </li>
    <p> Doing homework may not be the most fun activity in the world, but it is an important part of learning nonetheless. One way to make studying more enjoyable is to do it with your friends. There are many ways you can do this. For example, you could set up <strong>study groups</strong> or <strong>video chat </strong>each other while doing homework. Studying together is not only fun, but can be beneficial. You and your friends can share ideas, help each other out with difficult concepts, and provide new perspectives on certain problems. As long as you and your friends stay focused, this is a great way to socialize while also upholding your responsibilities. </p>
    <li> <strong>Participate in Extracurriculars Together</strong> </li>
    <p> Most high school students have commitments outside of school, whether it be volunteering, sports teams, clubs, or non-profit organizations. These commitments can take up quite a lot of time especially if you are dedicated. If your friends have similar interests, it would be a good idea to participate in these extracurriculars together. Not only would it make the experience more enjoyable, but it’s also a great way to<strong> bond while doing something you are all passionate about</strong>. </p>
    <li> <strong>Find a Job With Friends</strong> </li>
    <p> During high school, many students may begin to look for part-time jobs as a way to gain some experience in the workforce or just to make some money. An interesting way to make time for your friends while staying committed to a part-time job is to find a job together. In fact, there are <strong>some companies that want friends to apply together </strong>because of the associated pre-established chemistry and team dynamic. For example, McDonald’s Canada had a campaign called “Friends Wanted” where they encourage youths to apply together and would hire them together. Working with your friends will provide you with the benefits of a job while still maintaining an active social life. </p>
    <li> <strong>Make New Friends</strong> </li>
    <p> Being social doesn’t limit you to the same group of friends. Sometimes your friends are not interested in the same things as you. They may have taken different courses than you in school, they may have different hobbies and extracurricular activities, or they may not want to get a job. Although it is important to make time for the friends you already have, you can always find new people who share your interests and passions. It will also benefit you to interact with people outside of your usual circle because it is a great way to network and form new, long-lasting friendships. </p>
</ol>
<h3> Why Should I Care About Balance? </h3>
<p> Having a good balance of school, work, and social life is absolutely vital for your mental health. A good balance can prevent unnecessary stress and potential mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression. An active social life can also help you feel less isolated, which encourages you to talk about your problems and to seek help instead of bottling your feelings up inside. In addition, a good balance can really be beneficial when you are older and have more responsibilities (for example, if you attend Medical School you will definitely have a crushing amount of work, including but not limited to: research, clinical work, internships etc). </p>
<p> Hopefully these tips help you maintain an active social life within your busy lives! </p>
