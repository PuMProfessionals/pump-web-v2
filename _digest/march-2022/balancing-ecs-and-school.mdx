    Extracurriculars (ECs)  are a fantastic way to explore your interests, meet like-minded individuals, and practice many skills such as leadership, initiative, and organization. However, with all the extracurriculars out there that cater to nearly every passion, it is easy to get your foot stuck in one too many. At one point, it may become overwhelming to be involved in everything that you would want to be a part of while completing school work at the same time. Clearly, it is important to find a kind of balance to avoid this and to properly participate in your extracurriculars so that you don’t feel like a “half member” who cannot fully take on their responsibilities. In addition, having this balance ensures that you can also be on top of school and personal affairs. 

    <h2>1. Acknowledge what you are capable of</h2>
    You, as an individual, are aware of your own capabilities and time management skills. Using this, it is essential to know how much you can take on. If you know that you are excellent at using your time wisely, then it wouldn’t be a bad idea to take on a few extracurriculars. At the same time, you should not take on more than what you can handle. If you see that time and time again, you are neglecting school work to join meetings or ditching your teammates on a project to study, then you should ask if you are involved in too much. Knowing what you can and cannot do goes a long way. Keep in mind that all your roles in your extracurriculars should be manageable with your study load. Being president or having time consuming positions for multiple extracurriculars may not be a good idea depending on your individual circumstances, or it may be something available for you to experience -- reflect honestly about yourself to see what would be right for you!

    <h2>2. Allocate time for tasks</h2>
    Planning and organizing what your day looks like is crucial if you want to be able to balance both school work and your extracurriculars. Especially during exams and midterms, scheduling out periods to focus on school and leaving time necessary for extracurriculars can help relieve stress. See what requires more of your time to complete and schedule out time to work on those tasks. 

    <h2>3. Prioritize what extracurriculars will enhance your growth</h2>
    If you do find that you are in too many extracurriculars, it may be difficult to choose what to let go of. In this case, assess what you feel you can contribute to the most. Are your skills more applicable in one or is one more directed to what you plan on studying in the future? By doing this, you can maximize your experience in your extracurriculars while having that balance. 

    <h2>4. Keep in mind, extracurricular are optional </h2>
    Lastly, it is important to keep in mind that your academic endeavors should be one of your top priorities. You have probably heard this before, but before you are a student athlete, graphic designer, or club leader, you are a student! Extracurriculars are extra undertakings that can help sharpen your skills and enhance your resume if you are applying to university or other programs. However, your performance in school is a heavier deciding factor when applying for such programs, and is not optional, compared to extracurriculars. In this way, know that studying for your exams and getting assignments done on time is still very important, no matter what your extracurriculars are. 

    Being able to maintain this balance can help later on in university if you are working, or have an even heavier workload. To summarize, in order to balance extracurriculars in school, you must never take on more than what you can handle. Organize the time you spend on school work and extracurriculars, and keep in mind to prioritize your school work.
