  Not sure what career path to pursue? Not sure what it is like working in fields
  like microbiology, pathology, and more? In either case, one solution is getting
  involved in research! It is an amazing opportunity for students to learn more about
  their passions, as well as gain real experience learning and innovating in a field
  of their choosing.
</p>
<p>
  Taking part in a research project has so many benefits, ranging from improving your
  collaboration and communication, having the opportunity to network with other
  people who are interested in similar topics, discovering your interests, and
  providing a means to answer your own questions.
</p>
<p>
  Now that you know more about the reasons why research is so beneficial, you may be
  wondering how it is possible to get involved! As a high school student, it can be
  challenging to find a research position. Hopefully, these three points will make it
  easier for you to find a position that will help you grow!
</p>
<h1> 1. Reaching out to professors </h1>
<p>
  One fantastic way to get more research experience as a high school student is by
  reaching out to professors! One of the simplest ways to do this is by sending them
  an email or calling them, and inquiring whether they have a spot in their lab for a
  high school student! In your email/call, it is important to tell them what area you
  are interested in (ex. Biology, social science, economics, etc.), so you can get a
  placement tailored to your passions!
</p>
<p>
  Depending on the kind of research that you are interested in and the policies of
  the lab, you may be able to go in person to work in the lab!
</p>
<p>
  One unique benefit of this research opportunity is that you get the opportunity to
  learn from someone who has had a lot of experience! Professors have usually
  published many papers on the topic they teach, making them very knowledgeable in
  the field. You’d get the opportunity to learn more about research from a
  professional!
</p>
<h1> 2. Attend established research programs </h1>
<p>
  There are many organizations out there that have research programs that guide high
  school students through the research process, and some even help you craft a
  complete manuscript that can be sent to journals for publication!
</p>
<p>
  Depending on your availability, you can apply to a summer program (an example being
  the University of Alberta’s WISEST Summer Research Program) or a year-round program
  (an example being the University of Toronto’s student research program URECS). When
  signing up for these programs, keep in mind that they all tend to be quite time
  consuming, so make sure that you have enough time to fully commit so you can make
  the most out of the experience.
</p>
<h1> 3. Take part in research contests! </h1>
<p>
  Another great way to get research experience is by registering for research
  contests! This is a great option for those of us that need some time constraints to
  stop procrastinating.
</p>
<p>
  Most research contests will require you to come up with a project of your own (ie.
  Something that you will be doing your own independent research on!), and some even
  allow you to find a mentor to help you develop your project! A few examples of
  these contests are Sanofi Biogenius and the Canada Wide Science Fair.

  Hopefully, after having read this article, you have a better sense of how you can
  get research experience as a high school student!
