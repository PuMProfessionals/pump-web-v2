   The medical field is one that has a large scope of career options, from clinical psychologist to pediatrician to microbiologist. Given the diversity of options, it can be difficult to choose a particular career path without first reading into specific jobs, or better yet, gaining in-person experience in a medical workplace. As a person who’s undecided on a future medical career myself, I decided to volunteer at a local animal hospital over the past year to get a sense of the veterinary medicine environment. As an avid animal lover and pet owner, I thought that the position would be the optimal way not only to merge my aptitude with animals with my interest in the sciences but also to help determine whether or not a position in this particular environment would be right for me. In the end, aside from being a fun and dynamic workplace, the animal hospital I volunteered at helped foster important personal traits that are applicable not only to my academic and social life but also to future healthcare environments that require problem-solving and are fast-paced.

Initially, since I was still gaining familiarity with the workings of the clinic, I was given simple tasks that mainly revolved around cleaning, sanitization of both surfaces and surgery equipment, and holding animals during routine checkups. This required me to put my chemistry class knowledge of preparing solutions to use when mixing different cleaners and chemicals properly. However, after I had spent more time observing clinic procedures, I could help with key tasks involving patients, including collecting blood samples, applying pressure to veins, and staunching bleeding. I could also help administer medications (orally, subcutaneously, and mixed with food), give fluids, help with blood pressure tests, and prepare microscope samples, such as identifying the types and concentration of bacteria in residue from dogs’ ears. Aside from these scientific applications, I learned a lot about animal handling - from walking, washing, and grooming dogs, to playing with the animals to cleaning the kennels to ensure a comfortable boarding environment. I even learned nuances like distracting an animal with treats before a blood pressure reading was to be taken, how to collaborate with staff to securely hold an animal for blood or vaccine work, and how to prepare for euthanasia. Overall, my knowledge of cystoscopy, cytology, hematology, and animal anatomy were only a few of the subject areas this volunteering experience scratched the surface of in addition to simply animal care.

Furthermore, working at the animal hospital enhanced many of my soft skills. While some days are slower than others, the clinic could get busy especially on weekends, requiring quick-thinking, initiative, and stamina. Patient after patient required constant cleaning of examination room surfaces and equipment, periodic restocking of syringes, and filling out forms for each patient, to be transported between the examination area and reception. As a volunteer, I would always be there not only to facilitate these tasks, but also to take any boarding animals out for a walk, prepare kennels for cats or dogs, hold or comfort patients, and retrieve any important equipment the veterinary technicians needed. Overall, I became much more comfortable working in a fast-paced environment and with animals. 

Although I may not become a veterinarian in the future, volunteering at the animal hospital was a rewarding experience that taught me not only practical skills, but soft skills that are transferable to other healthcare workplaces. If you’re considering going into the medical field but aren’t sure of a specific profession, try volunteering at an animal hospital- it is definitely a scientifically enriching experience made all the more enjoyable by being able to work with pets. Many hospitals indicate on their website if they accept volunteers, but even if they do not explicitly state it, it can’t hurt to reach out anyways, explaining why you’d be interested in a position and what you can bring to the team. All in all, I can say with certainty that the benefits I reaped from this experience, including animal skills, people skills, and solidification of my biology and chemistry knowledge, are ones I’ll carry with me throughout my life, which is why the experience is one I highly recommend!
