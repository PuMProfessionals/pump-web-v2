        School, homework, extracurriculars. Stress is everywhere! I know I feel it on a day to day basis from teachers assigning way too many assignments and then deciding to have a test! It can feel extremely overwhelming, and sometimes you may feel stuck.Maybe we can't get rid of stress itself, but what if I told you that there are ways to minimize it through something as simple as music?

    <h2>What is stress and what happens to the brain under stress</h2>
    <div>
    Before we dive too deep on how music can help minimize stress let's start with what even is stress? A simple way to explain would be that stress occurs when we feel different pressures in our lives, impacting not only our body but also the mind. It is our body's natural defense system to help protect us against any danger. Therefore, in situations where we may feel unsafe our bodies flood with stress hormones in preparation to face the danger we may be in. This danger can be small, like public speaking or finishing your assignments on time or it can be large, such as trying to survive in a life threatening situation (zombie apocalypse). 

    So what happens to our bodies when we are stressed? Well, have you ever been in class and felt your heart rate increasing, or your palms getting sweaty before you write an exam or go up for a presentation? This is your body's fight or flight reaction. This is also a big aspect of how your body deals with stress. The simple way of describing fight or flight is your body's response to danger and to survive. The body's sympathetic nervous system will be activated due to the sudden release of hormones throughout your body. 

    Temporary stress is completely normal for everyone to experience, but chronic stress is where the issues lie. Severe stress can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, increased probability of getting sick, and many other issues. Hopefully none of us will need to deal with this! How could music help with that?

    <h2>Interview from a Eve Pourdrier (UBC Professor of music theory)</h2>
    <h3>Do you believe that music can help with stress reduction?</h3>
    <div>
    The word music often leads to the thought of instruments, singers, or any sounds in general. But even more than that, music actually has many benefits for your mental health including stress reduction! So, you may wonder: what music helps reduce stress the most? Originally, many people would think classical music or some spa music, but this is not always the case. Certain types of music may help lessen stress but this completely varies from person to person. Therefore, as long as you like the music, then it will benefit you positively and vice versa! For some, heavy metal can be the type of music they enjoy listening to, thus this music can be their stress reliever. However, for others who don't like this type of music, it can actually increase their stress. There is no one type of music in particular that will help relieve stress for everyone as it completely depends on the person. Now after reading this, take a second to think of your favourite song or type of music that makes you feel the most happy and next time you are stressed try listening to that song!
    Music itself may not have a direct impact on the brain to permanently reduce stress, but it can temporarily help lower stress levels. Entrainment plays  a big role  in this!The connection between the two may surprise you. When you are listening to music, do you ever find yourself tapping your finger, your foot or moving your head? That's entertainment!  A simple way to explain is when listening to music, there is something regular about the beat, making you inclined to move along. Your body may spontaneously synchronize to this external sound causing you to move! This movement is usually hard wired and is something that is incredibly hard to control. When moving along with the music, your brain can release chemicals, such as Dopamine. This is known as a “feel good chemical”. Dopamine is known to help you feel motivated and continue!
    Doing different activities that involve music can also be extremely beneficial! Going to the gym, dancing, or joining a choir are all fun activities that not only incorporate music but also increase social bonding, which is another key aspect to stress reduction. Some of you may be thinking: how do I have time to fit these extra curricular activities into my schedule? It may be tricky, but remember that it is just as important as schoolwork! I am personally in a choir, and after practice I feel recharged. Being surrounded with beautiful sounding music and my friends is the perfect combination to help me destress. 
    The certain beats of music may also have an impact. If the beat is slow, it may feel more relaxing and is known to reduce the heart rate. Fast beats will increase the heart rate and may make you want to move (exercise, dance, etc.) . This all varies on your preference of music as well as the situation. 

    Stress is going to be in your life whether you like it or not.If I could get rid of stress in general I would in an instant! Sadly, I can't do that. By incorporating something as simple as  music into your daily routine or life it can help you maintain some of your stress levels in the long term!
