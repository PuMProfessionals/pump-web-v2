    Engaging in high school leadership experiences presents itself as a valuable source of education, full of new possibilities and opportunities while helping hone new capabilities and effective work habits. The active role I played in my school's Health Occupation Students of America (HOSA) Chapter, has helped me develop my open-mindedness as I willingly take risks in the pursuit of knowledge. By initially taking on the role as a member and later as a leader, HOSA has given me well-rounded experiences from after school collaborations and to traveling across the country for competition. My HOSA involvement has solidified my determination to pursue health-related studies so that I continue my passion for improving the quality of life for others. 

HOSA is an incredibly educational experience due to the rewarding merits and valuable network that you meet. As an organization that informatively educates youth about relevant medical concepts, their competitive events offer a lively experience to conference with other health enthusiasts. My sophomore year allowed me to meet new like-minded health enthusiasts and collaborate upon a common goal - developing a medical invention. While the inspiration for this creation was primarily a challenge, my teammates and I found a common understanding for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. Within each meeting, we prepared our presentation, demonstration, and prototypes for the spring leadership date. After a successful experience, a first-place game treatment led us to the next level - International in Texas!

My trip to Dallas for the Health Occupation Students of America (HOSA) International Leadership Competition in the summer of 2017 was an enlightenment that taught me how to deal with a competitive atmosphere. My team and I were confident in our prototype due to its unique and interactive components, so we felt we would make the top 10!  However, disappointment quickly replaced our confidence when we did not meet our standards. On my return trip home, I took time to reflect on our loss which helped me to move forward. I got to acknowledge our efforts, the fun I had working with others on a meaningful project, the intimidation I felt seeing such a vast number of students across America competing, the creative innovations of those who made the top 10, and the general hard work and commitment of everyone who headed off to HOSA. Since it was my first time competing in an international competition, it allowed me to acknowledge the vast capabilities and talents each person possesses. 
I was still involved with HOSA for the rest of high school as I’ve enjoyed learning more about different health topics. Taking on a Junior Executive title in grade 11 and a presidency in grade 12, I oversaw the member selection system through written applications and interviews. Having gone through the same process myself when enrolling as a member and as an executive, I have experiences from both spectrums. It was unique because I got to hear about different people’s initiatives and goals, inspiring me to network with the club members and share interests. Alongside my leadership duties, I competed in the Medical Law and Ethics category to expand my knowledge in this area. Through my executive role and direction, I’m proud to have implemented an organized system for students to enjoy new medical endeavors. 
	HOSA has opened up opportunities to grow as a student, presenter, and a leader. As I head off to university this semester, I’m open to competing in HOSA at the postsecondary level. With a wide selection of health-related opportunities, students may continue to pursue new knowledge even as they reach higher levels of learning. HOSA is not only a chance to network and discover the field of health studies, but it’s also a chance to take risks and develop discipline in the captivating realm of medical development. HOSA aims to stimulate young minds and most importantly, continuously fuel interest and establish future medical professionals. As extracurricular participation can be significant in one's formative years, the interest and passion one brings along to it can result in new outlooks and wisdom.
