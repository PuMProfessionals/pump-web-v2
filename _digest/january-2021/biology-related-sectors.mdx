  <p>Historically, society has believed that certain vocations hold greater prestige than others, whether it be due to the achievements, gains or productivity-driven nature of the work.
    Biology-related sectors such as healthcare and medicine are especially influenced by these prejudices in a positive way. However, these claims can only be verified with evidence. This analysis aims to provide a further understanding through
    statistical evidence, and shed some light on how these perceptions came to be.</p>

  <h2>Income across all sectors</h2>

        This bar graph displays the median after-tax annual income of various Canadian sectors, and highlights the three main health/med/bio sectors in yellow; “Health professions and related programs,” “Biological and biomedical sciences,” and
        “Dental, medical and veterinary residency programs” respectively.

    </figure>

  <p>One of the most simple yet useful comparisons across all sectors is the total annual income. Evidently, “Dental, Medical and Veterinary residency programs” have the highest income, while the mean and median totals show how the other programs
    compare:</p>
 

  <h2> Educational Attainment and Graduates</h2>
  <p>Certain certifications are required for different sectors. By comparing the mean and median number of graduates to educational achievements, the general educational requirements for certain vocations can be interpreted.</p>

        This graph compares Educational Qualifications to the number of graduates within the healthcare sector (blue) to the mean (red) and median (yellow) number of graduates of all sectors.

  </div>

  <p>With the exception of undergraduate degrees, more difficult certifications are generally depicted as having less graduates.</p>
  <p>
    A huge discrepancy between the Healthcare sector and other sectors can be visibly seen in the training certificate columns. However, even though significantly more healthcare graduates
    have obtained this certification, the amount of these students obtaining more difficult degrees is similar to that of others.

  <h2>Two-variable Analysis: Graduates vs Enrolments</h2>
  <p>Comparing the number of graduates to enrolments of sectors can indicate student interest</p>

  <div align="center">
    <figure>
      <img src="/blog/january-2021/image3.png" alt="Graph of enrolments compared to graduates" />
      <figcaption>
        This graph shows a relation between the number of graduates to enrolments for certain sectors within one year, with the orange dot representing healthcare and the trendline representing the correlation between the two variables.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  <p>The trendline has an r-value of about 0.99, meaning that there is a strong, positive, linear correlation between the two variables. As the number of graduates increases, the number of enrolments increases proportionately.</p>
  <p>The Healthcare sector, which is slightly below the trendline, has had a slight decline in enrolments compared to graduates. However, since it still appears very close to the trendline, Healthcare still counts as “average” within this aspect.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p> Across these comparisons between various facets of education, income and career aspects of the medicine/biology/healthcare faction, this particular analysis has demonstrated its standing overall.</p>
  <p>Please bear in mind that this analysis is not all-encompassing, and data may change over time with different circumstances and generations. Sources of error may exist within the presentation of the data as well, so reference for further reading
