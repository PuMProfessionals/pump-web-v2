<h2> What is a Research Paper?</h2>

<p> A research paper is a model of investigated thoughts and findings from several primary and 
secondary sources. They usually follow the structure of an expanded essay and are essentially a 
guide to your findings. Their purpose is to interpret already known research and offer unique solutions 
and perspectives. </p>


<h2> What are the main types of research papers? </h2>

<p> Though, we think of scientific papers when we hear the term research, there are <strong>three main 
types</strong> of research papers: </p>

<h3> Analytical Research Paper </h3>

<p> Analytical research papers generally investigate an answer to a given topic. The writer views 
and writes upon a vast variety of viewpoints and includes sufficient evidence from strong sources. 
For this particular type of research paper, critical thinking is crucial as the writer must critically 
analyze and create their own conclusion. </p>

<h3> Argumentative Research Paper </h3>

<p> This type of research paper tends to persuade the readers into understanding a concept or 
theory which is rather seen as controversial or debatable. The writer begins by taking a stance in 
their thesis statement, and then argues a favoured perspective. </p>

<h3> Scientific Research Reports </h2>

<p> A scientific research paper uses several findings, tests, experiments and methods to uniformly 
deliver data to the scientific community. Scientific research papers follow a rather longer structure 
and can be easily browsed. They possess tables, graphs and results as well as a written analysis, etc. </p>

<h2> Writing an Outline </h2>

<p> The outline of a research paper is pivotal as it will ideally show you to arrange your thoughts 
in the most efficient way. Using a flow chart of jotting down points are key as they will allow your 
paper to follow a logical flow. </p>

<h2> How to Creeate An Outline </h2>

<p> An outline should not require more than 45 minutes. It should be brief with main points, 
necessary citations/sources if used, etc. This outline can be rearranged if new information is 
found and is <strong>not set in stone</strong>. </p>

<h2> Writing a Thesis, Body, and Conclusion </h2>

<p> <u>Thesis/Abstract</u> </p>

<p> The thesis holds the objective of the paper or the favoured viewpoint that will be supported throughout. 
It should be concise and can reference some primary sources. </p>

<ul>
    <li> Example of a thesis statement for an argumentative research paper on Why Peanut Butter and 
    Jelly Sandwiches are the best would be: <em>Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are the best type of sandwich
     because they are versatile, easy to make, and taste good</em>. <a href="https://nstep-online.org/persuasive-essay-thesis-statement-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(https://nstep-online.org/persuasive-essay-thesis-statement-examples/)</a> </li>
    <li> As seen above, the writer takes a stance and includes primary sources such as, 
    easy to make, taste good and versatile. </li>
</ul>

<p> <u>Body</u> </p>

<p> With the usage of an outline, body paragraphs will be easier to write! Remember to incorporate all supporting ideas to ensure that your main idea for each paragraph is successfully proven. </p>
