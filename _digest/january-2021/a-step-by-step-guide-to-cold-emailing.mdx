	<h1>Step 1: Research!</h1>
		<p>Get to know your recipient.
		Scan their social media profiles such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, as well as their website if they have one.
		Make sure to also follow their accounts and interact with them through commenting, liking, and engaging with their content.
		Giving their content value and showing interest will grab their attention, and this way, you will appear as less of a stranger.
		It shows that you care and you are very targeted towards who you are reaching out to.</p>
	<h1>Step 2: Finding the Email</h1>
		<p>Sometimes, it isn’t so easy to determine the email of whomever you are trying to email.
		You can check out their bios and contact pages, or search them up on email hunter websites.
		Email hunters will search up the domains of emails.
		Alternatively, you could reach out to them through their social media accounts.
		Remember that emails aren’t the only way to communicate!
		Try messaging them on whichever platform they are most active on to increase your chances of getting a response!</p>
	<h1>Step 3: Writing the Message</h1>
		<p>
		There are five main parts to a cold email/message:
		<ul>
			<li>The hook
				<ul>
					<li>Your target may be getting tons of emails and messages everyday.
						You’ll need to grab their attention and draw in their interest right off the bat.
						To do so, you need to empathize with them.
						What is on their minds right now?
						What would they want to read?
						Talk about something you inherently care about.
						This would be the subject of your email, or the first thing they read when they see your message.
						This is also why researching is key!</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>Your offer
					<ul>
							<li>What have you done, or what do you have for your recipient?
							Make sure to frame this based on their needs!</li>
					</ul></li>
			<li>Relevance
					<ul>
							<li>Why is your offer relevant to whoever you are contacting?
							To do so, tie their experience to yourself.
							Show them that you know who they are, what they do, and what they are looking for.</li>
					</ul></li>
			<li>The Action
				<ul>
						<li>Now, you want to make your reason for reaching out actionable.
						What do you want out of emailing the person?
						Do you want to ask questions?
						Give a demo? Hop on a quick call?
						A job?
						A reference?
						A speaker for your next event?
						Be clear as to what you are asking for.</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>Your Credibility
				<ul>
						<li>Show that you are not just a spam email.
						Prove to them that you have done your work and you are being serious.
						You can demonstrate that you have done your research through asking good questions that refer to specific information about them.
						You don’t want to seem like you don’t know what you are talking about, or that you mass sent this email that can apply to anyone.</li>
				</ul></li>
		</ul></p>
	<h1>Step 4: Follow-up!</h1>
		<p>Don’t feel discouraged if you don’t hear back!
			Sometimes, it’s not that they are not interested, but they simply forgot to respond.
			Did you know that most busy people don’t reply back until after four emails are sent?
			Always make sure to follow up 2-3 times, no more and no less.
			After they have responded, make sure to stay in touch with them.
			This doesn’t mean messaging them every week, but check in with them every year and show them your progress.
			Show that contacting them was of value to you, and how it impacted you later on.
			Continue to interact with them on social media by engaging with their content!
			Finally, put a smile on their face and end off with a note of positivity.
			You want to leave with a good impression!</p>
